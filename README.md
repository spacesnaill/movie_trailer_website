# How to Use:

Python Version: 3.6.5 <br>
Open the terminal on MacOS or Linux, or the command prompt on Windows and type in 'python' and 'python3' to see if you have that version of Python or later. Simply entering 'python' may return the version of Python 2 on your system, in that case try Python3. <br>

If you do not have Python on your system, then follow this guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/
<br>
<br>

Pipenv Installation:

While you can just grab pip and install the necessary requirements for this program, it's better to use a virtual environment to better organize everything. Pipenv is a great tool for this and instructions for downloading and setting it up can be found here: <br>http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
